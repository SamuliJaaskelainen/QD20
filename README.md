# QD20

QD20 is a quantum powered icosahedron dice.

When you the roll the dice the quantum computer decides which side the dice has landed.

It is the most random dice humankind has ever rolled. Guaranteed by the laws of physics.


Technically we have accelerometer inside the dice that we translate to mouse movements to know if the dice is rolling. You can use this program without the physical dice by waving the mouse around.
